This branch `restful` is my attempt to integrate Django, REST, and the models trained as part of this project.
For now it will just be stub/tutorial code, then to be switched out with actual models.

One approach would be Flask: 
https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-a-machine-learning-model-as-a-rest-api-4a03b865c166
. But I'd rather use Django so I don't see the *near-term* value of scaling a Flask learning curve, although of course 
it's good to know.

So instead I want to follow 
[this link](https://medium.com/@mahdi04/train-predict-simple-machine-learning-models-with-django-rest-76ce46bf2868). Stay tuned.
