My intuition is that they should be positively correlated, because the media reflects the public's interest in stability. The most interesting story I've found so far is that the tone of coverage trends downwards for time while controlling for the Goldstein score of each kind of event:"

    "Each year is associated with a -0.20 change in average tone, holding constant the theoretical propensity of the events to promote stability (i.e. holding constant the Goldstein score). Each 1.0 point increase in the Goldstein store is associated with a +0.13 change, holding constant the date.\n",
    "\n",
    "In isolation, all we can tell from the MSRE is that a mean absolute value of the std error would be sqrt(8.3) ~= 2.9. In principle avgtone can run from -100 to 100, but in practice it seems to usually be between 0 and 10. So, missing estimates by 2.8 seems not-great; however, it's a more useful metric to compare to other analyses than in isolation. The r-squared looks pretty nice for just my first attempt at specifying a regression with two independent variables, but I should be cautious about this metric as I run more regressions and risk overfitting.\n",

    "To get interesting answers, I need good questions. This is what makes this project more than just an extended SQL or PySpark tutorial. In this kind of research there's going to be some iteration in RQs, because things you think *a priori* might be interesting turn out not to be, and vice versa. So this is largely a running list of ideas, .\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Media tone and stability** - The Rosenstein score is a measure of how each kind of action promotes or erodes stability. The tone score is something about the tone of the media coverage of the event. See above.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Actor affinity by dyad** - Do some actor dyads consistently produce higher scores (Rosenstein or media tone) than others? I'd think this would be a trivial \"Yes\" because relationships between allies should produce more positive news than those between adversaries. So this is exploring the obvious, but a good sanity check to make sure I'm understanding the nature of this data.\n",
