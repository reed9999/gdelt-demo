My intuition is that they should be positively correlated, because the media reflects the public's interest in stability. The most interesting story I've found so far is that the tone of coverage trends downwards for time while controlling for the Goldstein score of each kind of event:"

In this kind of research there's going to be some iteration in RQs, because things you think *a priori* might be interesting turn out not to be, and vice versa. So this is largely a running list of ideas, .\n",

    "1. **Actor affinity by dyad** - Do some actor dyads consistently produce higher scores (Rosenstein or media tone) than others? I'd think this would be a trivial \"Yes\" because relationships between allies should produce more positive news than those between adversaries. So this is exploring the obvious, but a good sanity check to make sure I'm understanding the nature of this data.\n",
