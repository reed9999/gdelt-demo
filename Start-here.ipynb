In principle avgtone can run from -100 to 100, but in practice it seems to usually be between 0 and 10. So, missing estimates by 2.8 seems not-great; however, it's a more useful metric to compare to other analyses than in isolation. The r-squared looks pretty nice for just my first attempt at specifying a regression with two independent variables, but I should be cautious about this metric as I run more regressions and risk overfitting.\n",

In this kind of research there's going to be some iteration in RQs, because things you think *a priori* might be interesting turn out not to be, and vice versa. So this is largely a running list of ideas, .\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Actor affinity by dyad** - Do some actor dyads consistently produce higher scores (Rosenstein or media tone) than others? I'd think this would be a trivial \"Yes\" because relationships between allies should produce more positive news than those between adversaries. So this is exploring the obvious, but a good sanity check to make sure I'm understanding the nature of this data.\n",
