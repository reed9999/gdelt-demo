## Import error notes

I'm presently using MySQL Workbench to import the tab-delimited files into my DB on 
AWS.
When it fails halfway through the data, I'd like to keep a record--
I can get some value as a demo/dry run just from
charging ahead rather than digging into the troubleshooting, but ultimately I need to come back 
and fix these soon.

import 1: loaded 2982 but it doesn't seem to have been the *first* 2982.
