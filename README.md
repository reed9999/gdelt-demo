Demonstration project--Learning to do interesting stuff with AWS and the GDELT dataset

## Why?
I have some data sciencey, big dataish skills from my PhD program; now I need a millieu to showcase and keep building them. 

The premise is that I want to use a big open dataset on AWS and do some analysis (using data science skills) while learning the AWS stuff. [GDELT, the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone](https://registry.opendata.aws/gdelt/) seems like a good choice because media and language are interesting to me.

## Additional showcase
[This is my first-authored paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X16302368) using a million row dataset that we got published. About 90% of the analysis and 90% of the prose is mine, although the dataset was preexisting. I wrote this code in R and am working to get it up here.

[This was some exploratory work](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2909632) that died there because we couldn't find anything attention-grabbing to study, at least not in the initial investigations. Nevertheless it gave me a good chance to use numpy/pandas and to learn a little bit of QGIS.

I also did a lot of qualitative research. I'm a big believer in mixed quant/qual methods.
